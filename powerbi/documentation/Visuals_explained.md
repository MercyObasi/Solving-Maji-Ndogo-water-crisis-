# Visuals Explained
This document guides users on how to interpret and interact with the various charts, graphs, and tables within the Maji Ndogo Water Services Dashboard.

## 1. Location Type Visualizations
These visuals help decision-makers understand population distribution and where most resources need to be directed.
### A. Population by Location Type (Bar Chart)
* **Description:** A bar chart that divides the total population of people per province by their location type (Rural vs. Urban).
* **Purpose:** Helps stakeholders understand which provinces have the highest populations and whether those populations are predominantly rural or urban. This guides high-level budget allocation.
* **Interaction:** Hover over the bars to see exact population numbers.

### B. Water Source Dependence (Bar Chart)
* **Description:** A bar chart that divides the population of people who rely on a specific type of water source (e.g., Well, Tap) by rural/urban population.
* **Purpose:** Identifies which water sources support the most people in which environments, ensuring the most impactful source types are prioritized during infrastructure planning.

## 2. Number of Improvements Visualizations
These charts provide a clearer view of which types of improvements need more attention nationally and regionally.
### A. Improvements per Province (Column Chart)
* **Description:** A column chart displaying the count of each required improvement type, stacked per province.
* **Purpose:** Allows leaders to see exactly which provinces have the most significant infrastructure backlogs and the nature of those backlogs.
* **Interaction**: Drill-through Capability. You can right-click on a specific province's column and select "Drill through" to navigate to the detailed, dedicated page for that specific province.

### B. Total Improvements Summary (Bar Chart)
* **Description:** A single bar chart that simply counts the total number of each improvement required across the entire nation.
* **Purpose:** Provides a national summary of the most common issues (e.g., "Fix Pump" vs. "Install Pipes").

## 3. Bookmarks and Detailed Tables
These interactive elements provide granular budget and quantity details.
### A. Improvements Bookmark (Table)
* **Description:** A detailed table summarizing the quantity required and the estimated budget for each type of improvement. The budget is calculated by multiplying the unit cost by the total quantity.
* **Key Insight:** This view highlights that "Installation of RO filter" and "Drilling of wells" draw the highest amount of money, informing where large capital allocation is needed.
* **How to View:** Navigate to the main page and press Ctrl + Click (or Cmd + Click on Mac) on the "Province/Improvement" button to activate this view.

### B. Province Bookmark (Table and Pie Chart)
* **Description:** A table that summarizes the total population, total quantity of improvements needed, and the total budget required per province. A supporting pie chart highlights the proportional budget allocation across provinces.
* **Purpose:** Helps the government quickly identify which provinces need the most resources and provides the data (population vs. cost) to justify those allocations.

## 4. Province-Specific Detail Pages (Drill-Through Target)
Each province page provides a deep dive into local data:
* **Budget Allocation Charts:** Pie charts show the percentage budget allocation for each improvement type and by location type (Rural/Urban) within that specific province.
* **Town-Level Detail Table:** A table detailing the budget, population, improvement count, and cost per citizen for every town within the province.
* **Summary Insight:** The summary generally shows that rural areas in every province (except Amanzi) dominate in terms of population and required resources, which is a key factor to consider alongside logistics like transportation costs.
