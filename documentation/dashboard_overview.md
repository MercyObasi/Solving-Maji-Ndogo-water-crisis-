## Project Overview

This dashboard tells a hopeful story for the people of Maji Ndogo. Using data gathered from field surveys, it shows where water is flowing, where it has stopped, and what needs to be done to restore access.
It breaks down the survey findings so anyone can quickly understand the state of water access across the country, as well as within each province. Because most residents live in either rural or urban communities, the dashboard also separates their results, making it easier to see the unique challenges each group faces.
It highlights how many people are struggling with limited or unreliable water supply and groups these challenges into clear categories. Just as importantly, it shows the estimated cost required to fix these issues and identifies where funds need to be directed.
The proposed budgets and upgrade costs are summarized at the national level, by province, and across rural and urban areas, giving a full picture of what it will take to improve water access in Maji Ndogo.
